Your task is to audit and improve the documentation within this repository. Please follow these steps meticulously:

**1. Documentation Audit**
Analyze the codebase to identify gaps in documentation. Prioritize:
* **Missing Docstrings:** Public classes or functions with no explanation.
* **Unclear Parameters:** Functions where input/output types or purposes are ambiguous.
* **Outdated Examples:** README files or usage guides that no longer match the code.

**2. Improvement Strategy**
Before writing, briefly outline:
* **Scope:** The specific files or modules you will document.
* **Target Audience:** Specify if you are writing for end-users (API docs) or other developers (inline comments).

**3. Content Implementation**
Write clear, concise, and grammatically correct documentation.
* **Adherence:** Follow standard conventions for the language (e.g., JSDoc for JavaScript, Google Style for Python, GoDocs for Go).
* **Context:** Explain *why* a complex block of code exists, not just *what* it is doing.

**4. Review & Formatting**
* Verify that your comments do not clutter the code unnecessarily.
* Ensure any markdown files (like README.md) render correctly and link to valid resources.

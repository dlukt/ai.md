Your task is to find and fix a single, verifiable bug within this repository. Please follow these steps meticulously:

**1. Codebase Analysis & Bug Identification**
Systematically analyze the codebase to identify a potential bug. This could be a logical error, an unhandled edge case, or a deviation from documented behavior. 
* **Constraint:** Prioritize bugs that are verifiable with a clear failure case.

**2. Detailed Bug Report**
Before writing any code, provide a brief report explaining:
* The **file and line number(s)** where the bug is located.
* A **clear description** of the bug and its impact on the user or system.
* Your **proposed strategy** for fixing it.

**3. Targeted Fix Implementation**
Implement the most direct and clean fix for the identified bug. Avoid making unrelated refactors or style changes in the process.

**4. Verification Through Testing**
To validate your fix, you must:
* **Write a new test case** that specifically fails *before* your fix and passes *after* it, proving the bug is resolved.
* **Run the entire existing test suite** to ensure your changes have not introduced any regressions.

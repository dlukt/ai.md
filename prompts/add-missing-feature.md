Your task is to identify and implement a single, cohesive missing feature within this repository. Please follow these steps meticulously:

**1. Codebase Exploration & Feature Selection**
Systematically analyze the codebase to identify a meaningful feature gap. This could be resolving a documented "TODO," implementing a missing method in an interface, or adding a logical extension to existing functionality. 
* **Constraint:** Prioritize features that are self-contained and provide immediate value without requiring a full architectural rewrite.

**2. Implementation Plan**
Before writing any code, provide a brief proposal outlining:
* **The Feature:** A clear description of the functionality you intend to add.
* **The Rationale:** Why this feature is necessary or beneficial based on the current codebase state.
* **The Strategy:** Where this code will live (files/classes) and how it integrates with existing logic.

**3. Idiomatic Implementation**
Implement the feature using the most direct and clean approach.
* Ensure your code matches the existing style, naming conventions, and design patterns of the repository.
* Avoid scope creep; focus strictly on the selected feature.

**4. Verification & Documentation**
To validate your implementation, you must:
* **Test:** Write a new test case that verifies the success of the new feature.
* **Verify:** Run the existing test suite to ensure no regressions were introduced.
* **Document:** Add or update any necessary code comments or docstrings to explain the new functionality.
